      **History of the Android Mascot**

      You probably know that the Android operating system, maintained by Google, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious history. Follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.

      **The First Version**

      The first attempt to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and came from a developer named Dan Morrill. He recounts that he opened Inkscape (a free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was merely to personify the system just for his team; there was no company request for creating a mascot.

      This bizarre first version was even named in honor of its creator: they would be called the Dandroids.

      **A New Mascot Emerges**

      The idea of having a mascot matured, and the mission was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant manner.

      Irina's main idea was to graphically represent everything with few strokes and in a flatter manner. The drawing also had to quickly generate identification for those who looked at it. Thus, Bugdroid, the new Android mascot, was born.

      The main inspiration for the lines of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the Google office, looked over at the bathroom signs, and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, and objective.

        Another curious fact about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
        1.5 - Cupcake
        1.6 - Donut
        3.0 - Eclair
        2.2 - Froyo
        2.3 - Gingerbread
        3.0 - Honeycomb
        4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich
        4.1 - Jelly Bean
        4.4 - KitKat
        5.0 - Lollipop
        6.0 - Marshmallow
        7.0 - Nougat
        8.0 - Oreo
        9.0 - Pie
        Unfortunately, Android Q never existed, as Google decided to end this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.
        Visit the Android History site to see the sequence of the "sweet" versions and what each brought to the Android system.
