      <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>

      <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious history. Follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

      <h2>The First Version</h2>

      <p>The first attempt to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://ausdroid.net/news/2013/01/04/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascots-that-could-have-been/" target="_blank" class="external-link">Dan Morrill</a>. He recounts that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="external-link">Inkscape</a> (a free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was merely to personify the system just for his team; there was no company request for creating a mascot.</p>

      <p>This bizarre first version was even named in honor of its creator: they would be called the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

      <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>

      <p>The idea of having a mascot matured, and the mission was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="external-link">Irina Blok</a>, also a <strong>Google</strong> employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant manner.</p>

      <p>Irina's main idea was to graphically represent everything with few strokes and in a flatter manner. The drawing also had to quickly generate identification for those who looked at it. Thus, <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new <strong>Android</strong> mascot, was born.</p>

      <img class="small" src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid">

      <p>The main inspiration for the lines of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office, looked over at the bathroom signs, and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, and objective.</p>

        <p>Another curious fact about <strong>Android</strong> is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
          <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
          <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
          <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
          <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
          <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
          <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
          <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
          <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
          <li>5.0 - Lollipop</li>
          <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
          <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
          <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
          <li>9.0 - Pie</li>          
        </ul>

        <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android</strong> Q never existed, as <strong>Google</strong> decided to end this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to <strong>Android</strong> 10.</p>
